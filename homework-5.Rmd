## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

```{r}
library(janitor)
pokemon <- read.csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
pokemon_cleannames <- clean_names(pokemon)

# original names
colnames(pokemon)
colnames(pokemon_cleannames)
```

As a result shown, the column names are tidied in which uppercase are transformed into lowercase, dot is also transformed into underline. clean_names function can be used to make column names more standard.

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

```{r}
pokemon_cleannames%>%group_by(type_1)%>%summarise(Counts=n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Counts,y=reorder(type_1,Counts)))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+labs(x='Type',y='Counts')

pokemon1<-pokemon_cleannames%>%
  filter(type_1%in%c('Bug', 'Fire', 'Grass', 
                     'Normal', 'Water', 'Psychic'))%>%
  mutate(type_1=factor(type_1),
         legendary=factor(legendary),
         generation=factor(generation))
```

There are 18 types of these pokemons, the flying type pokemons are very rare.

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
train_test <- initial_split(pokemon1, prop = 0.70,
                               strata = type_1)
train_test

train <- training(train_test)
test <- testing(train_test)

folds <- vfold_cv(train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
```

As a result, training set contains 318 observations and testing set contains 140 observations. 

Stratifying sampling can be used to make the training and testing sets are equal in proportions of levels. 

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
recipe <- recipe(type_1~legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+
           defense+hp+sp_def,data=train)%>%
  step_dummy(legendary)%>%
  step_dummy(generation)%>%
  step_center(all_predictors())%>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())%>%prep()
```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?

```{r}
elastic_spec <- multinom_reg(mixture = tune(), penalty = tune() )%>%
  set_mode("classification")%>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

elastic_workflow <- workflow()%>%add_recipe(recipe)%>%
  add_model(elastic_spec)

param_grid <- grid_regular(mixture(range = c(0, 1)) , 
                           penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), 
                           levels = 10)

```

Due to two hyper-parameters, mixture and penalty, are tuned, of which 10 levels are existed in each hyper-parameter. Thus there are 10\*10=100 combinations. Besides, 5-folds cross validation is performed in which total $10*10*5=500$ models are fitted.

### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
tune <- tune_grid(
  elastic_workflow,
  resamples = folds,
  grid = param_grid
)
autoplot(tune)
```

Accuracy and AUC of ROC are not monotonic with `penalty` and `mixture`. In fact, while penalty is 0.021, the accuracy reach the highest. Besides, while penalty is 0.021, the best value of mixture is 0.888 due to the accuracy and AUC of ROC reached largest. 

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
(best_param1 <- select_best(tune, metric = "roc_auc"))
```

As a result, the best parameters are selected as penalty=0.00167 and mixture=1. 

```{r}
final_model <- fit(finalize_workflow(elastic_workflow, best_param1), 
                       data = train)
augment(final_model, new_data = test)%>%
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)

```

As a result, the estimated accuracy is 0.371.

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

```{r}
augment(final_model , new_data = test)%>%
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1 - specificity, y = sensitivity)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_abline(lty = 3) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_bw()+
  facet_wrap(vars(.level))
```

It can be shown that the performance of these types are different. The AUC of ROC is largest for Normal, which indicates that this model performs best in predicting whether it is Normal. Similarly, the worst type is Water for this model. The unbalance of each type of these pokemons may cause the difference performance for these types.
